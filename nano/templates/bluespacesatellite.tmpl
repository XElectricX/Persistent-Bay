<h2>This satellite will create a logistics network that can be used to manage employees of multiple ranks, assignments with different access, connect to wireless devices, send exports and recieve imports.

<div class='item'>
	<div class='itemLabel'>
		Network UID:
	</div>
	<div class='itemContent'>
		{{:helper.link(data.chosen_uid, '', {'change_uid' : '1'})}}
	</div>
</div>
The network UID is permanent and can never be changed. It is used when connecting to the network through he core logistics program.<br><br><br>
<div class='item'>
	<div class='itemLabel'>
		Full Network Name:
	</div>
	<div class='itemContent'>
		{{:helper.link(data.chosen_name, '', {'change_name' : '1'})}}
	</div>
</div>
This can be changed at any time and should be the full unabbreviated name for the government, corperation or whatever is being managed by the logistics network.<br><br><br>
<div class='item'>
	<div class='itemLabel'>
		Short Network Name:
	</div>
	<div class='itemContent'>
		{{:helper.link(data.chosen_short, '', {'change_short' : '1'})}}
	</div>
</div>
This is the abbreviated or shortened name for the network. This can be changed at any time.<br><br><br>
<div class='item'>

		Network password:
	</div>
	<div class='itemContent'>
		{{:helper.link(data.chosen_password, '', {'change_password' : '1'})}}
	</div>
</div>
This password is used when accessing the network through the core logistics program. It is required along with an ID carrying leadership access (1) to make critical changes to the network.<br><br><br>
<div class='item'>
	<div class='itemLabel'>
		Wireless net uid:
	</div>
	<div class='itemContent'>
		{{:helper.link(data.chosen_netuid, '', {'change_netuid' : '1'})}}
	</div>
</div>
This is the starting uid for the wireless network that devices will connect to to associate with your lognet. This cannot have spaces but can be changed (although not to an existing wireless uid). Your wireless network will start without a password, but not visible on the public network lists. You can set a wireless password or change the visibility in the core logistics program once the network is created.<br><br><br>
<div class='item'>
	<div class='itemLabel'>
		Network Leader:
	</div>
	<div class='itemContent'>
		{{:data.starting_leader}}
	</div>
</div>
Swipe an ID card to set the leader. The network leader always has all-access no matter what their assignment is. The network leader will be the only person able to access the logistics network until they create additional assignments with leadership access (1).<br>
<br><br><br><br>
{{:helper.link('Launch', '', {'launch' : '1'})}}
The satellite will only launch once the network is configured and the device is positioned in space.
